## Why learn JavaScript?

HTML gives the structure to the webpage and CSS can be used for styling the page but JavaScript makes web pages more dynamic and user-friendly so that they respond to visitors’ actions.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is widely used in web development. If you are interested in a career in web development, JavaScript is a must-learn language.

## What is JavaScript?

Initially released in 1995 by Netscape, JavaScript is a dynamic language, meaning that it can be run on the client side (in the user's web browser) or on the server side (on a web server). JavaScript is an object-oriented language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects, which are collections of related data and functionality.

The programs in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

## Vanilla JavaScript

Vanilla JavaScript just means the basic language without any libraries or frameworks. There’s no difference between vanilla JavaScript and JavaScript—it’s just there to emphasize the usage of plain JavaScript without the use of libraries and frameworks.

## Errors

The webpage itself doesn't display the error. You can right-click and then choose to inspect the element. Click on the console option where you can find details about the error.
